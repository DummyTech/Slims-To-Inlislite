## Important Notes
Due to some formating error scripts. You **WILL HAVE TO RESAVE THE RESULTS** using worksheet software, like WPS office or Microsoft Excel for it to work.

## Limitation
- This script doesn't migrate photos or snippet of books and members
- The export books results will be sliced by 100 books each. So it wont take a lot of time to load to Inlislite

## Addition Notes
The loading in inlislite will take quite bit of time. But it will work.
