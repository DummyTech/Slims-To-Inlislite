## Important Notes
Due to some formating error scripts. You **WILL HAVE TO RESAVE THE RESULTS** using worksheet software, like WPS office or Microsoft Excel for it to work.

### Addition Notes
- Export files from Slims/Senayan has to be placed adjecent or in one directory with the script.
- The loading in inlislite will take quite bit of time. But it will work.

## Why choose this way insted of swaping columns in excel?
### Advatage 
The advatage of using this script rather than moving data column using worksheet software are:
- Once the column ordered up, no need to redo it again in the future.
- Column rule can be adjusted based on your needs and it's writen in code. So it also can have complex condition formula.
- Automatically adjust format to Inlislite import format, which is required to import data to Inlislite.

### Limitation
There are also some limitation and possible improvement:
- This script doesn't migrate photos or snippet of books and members
- The export books results will be sliced by 100 books each. So it wont take a lot of time to load to Inlislite
- Unclean exports

At the end it's up to your needs.
